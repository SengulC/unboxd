        "review": "Oh my god, amazing. Who would've thought League of Legends would've provided the lore for one of the best animated shows to ever exist. Or just shows in general. Redefined TV for me, some of the greatest implementations of 'show not tell' in recent TV, and with the abundance of spoon-feeding streaming shows, this was such a gem. Needless to say that it has impeccable animation, and such a creative approach to characterization that it almost made me re-install Maya. Great character development, and deterioration when called for - perfection.",

        "review": "My favorite show in recent times. I came across it randomly in my 2nd year of university and the sincere approach to a chef's storyline and film-level cinematography captivated me. I've rewatched it like 2 times now and that fishes episode still hits the same.",

Love Rachel Sennot, Emma Seligman, Ayo Edebiri, I'll eat up anything they'll make, direct, produce or star in!! From Shiva Baby to Bottoms, what a track record. There are some imperfections and ADR-annoyances but what the movie lacks in perfect editing it more than makes up in needle drops.",

        "review": "Although the tale of a gruesome couple, unravelling Maren and Lee's story (and their victims) does more damage to the heart than the stomach. A beautiful coming-of-age love story with even more beautiful cinematography accompanied by the most beautiful couple. Grossly lacking Ethel Cain in the score though.",
