## Unboxd
Unboxd is a platform for me to practice my web design and development skills while documenting and keeping track of my favorite media, recipes, and more!
It is heavily inspired (albeit not visually) by Letterboxd.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
