## Unboxd
Unboxd is a platform for me to practice my web design and development skills while documenting and keeping track of my favorite media, recipes, and more!
It is heavily inspired (albeit not visually) by Letterboxd.

It is currently not deployed so you would have to clone the repository and host it locally.

## Local hosting

First, install the dependencies then run the development server:

```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
