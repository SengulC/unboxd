## Unboxd
Unboxd is a platform for me to practice my web design and development skills while documenting and keeping track of my favorite media, recipes, and more!
It is heavily inspired (albeit not visually) by Letterboxd.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies then run the development server:

```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
